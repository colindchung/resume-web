    description: "I joined Geek Education as a part-time programming instructor and I am currently still working there. In the past, I have been a tennis coach for 5 years and a private tutor for 2 years, and my love for teaching was one of the primary reasons I joined Geek Education. I tutor students aged 9-14 privately in Python, Java and Scratch based on the curriculum provided to me.",

        "One of the most difficult and fulfilling parts of this job is catering the lessons to the students strengths, weaknesses and programming goals. Some of my students want to learn programming for game or web development, whereas others want to learn for the purpose of pursuing STEM related fields in high school and postsecondary. Depending on their weaknesses and goals, this shapes the types of projects I choose to help them with to boost their learning and get the most out of the lessons.",
        "Some types of projects I have helped my students with include basic games like Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four and Hangman, as well as interactive console applications such as an implementation of a bank and a grade manager for teachers. These projects help combine the core computer science fundamentals such as classes, functions, loops and basic data structures.",
        "The last aspect of the job is trial lessons. Geek Education offers a free trial lesson for all students to decide if they want to pursue the lessons. I give a dry run of the introductory lesson and encourage the students to sign up. This is notable experience for me because I am directly involved in the business and it is important for me to give a lesson which is enjoyable and an appropriate level of difficulty."
