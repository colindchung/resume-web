    topics: "The main topics in this course were popular instruction set architectures (x86, ARM), pipelined, dynamically scheduled and parallel processors, multiprocessors and cache structures. The labs cumulated into creating a functional pipelined RISC-V processor that processes all instructions given in the specification (ADD, ADDI, etc.).",
