    description: "Design and modelling of digital hardware systems using a hardware description language. Development process. Impact of implementation technologies. Performance analysis and optimization. Functional verification. Timing analysis. Power analysis and optimization. Faults and testability. Reliability and fault tolerance.",
    topics: "The course focused on performance analysis, memory management and fault tolerance of digitial hardware programs using System Verilog. The labs were centered around pipelining, timing analysis and signal processing and they culminated with building a systolic array used for matrix multiplication that modelled Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).",
