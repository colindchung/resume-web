    topics: "The major topics in this course were process and thread management, system calls, concurrency (mutexes, semaphores, monitors and barrier synchronization) and user-level memory management. The labs used web crawling and image processing as busy work to focus on concurrency and performance optimization using inter-process communication, non-blocking I/O and the producer/consumer model.",
