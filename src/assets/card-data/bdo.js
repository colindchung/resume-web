    description: "I joined BDO Canada as a Full-Stack Microsoft Developer for my 3rd and 4th Co-op placements. Both terms were remote due to COVID 19, but I got to work on several projects ranging from internal tools and client facing applications. Some highlights of my work at BDO include the database and backend design for a client facing application, creating an email invoice automation tool and implementing full-stack features for several applications.",

        "In my first term at BDO, I worked on an internal tool used for resource management with 2 other coop students and 1 full time developer. I was responsible for application support including many bug fixes and several new features. I implemented a profitability calculator where I was responsible for creating the UI, data models and API endpoints. I also implemented an audit trail feature that tracks all actions that affect the database and I created a corresponding record-based security framework.",
        "Towards the end of my first internship, I was asked to also build an email automation tool that employees would use to send invoices to all clients. Since we had several hundred clients, manually sending out these emails would take an entire weekend. I designed a basic UI that allows the user to select a template, verify the email list and select an email signature. Using this tool, we were able to decrease the invoice email process to under 20 minutes total.",
        "In my second internship, I was given the opportunity to take more ownership of a project when I joined a data mining project as the primary developer. I was given the freedom to design the database schema, build the backend data models and create the API endpoints. I was also in charge of configuring multitenancy for commercial use and a role-based security framework."
