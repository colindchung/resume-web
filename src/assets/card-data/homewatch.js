    description: "HomeWatch is a product I made with three other peers at Hack the North 2019. It is an AI powered home security system that performs facial and license plate recognition to provide more insights than a traditional system. It monitors the door and driveway and performs facial recognition on anyone approaching and parses the license plate of any vehicles that enter the driveway. With this functionality in conjunction with the web and mobile applications we created, homeowners can have full transparency about who is approaching their home.",

The mobile app is meant to allow users to log in and see a live history of all people and cars that have recently entered the driveway.
